# Python Concurrent Chat Application

A minimal, reliable **multi-user chat system** built with Python sockets.  
This project was created as an independent learning exercise to strengthen networking, troubleshooting, and documentation skills.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Multi-client broadcast with threading  
- Simple commands:  
  - `/users` – list online users  
  - `/help` – show quick help  
  - `/quit` – exit the chat  
- Logging to `logs/server.log` for easy troubleshooting  
- Graceful disconnects & basic error handling  
- Clear documentation and runbook-style instructions

## 🖥️ Quick Start

### 1. Clone this repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KaziBadrulArif/Python-ChatApp.git
cd Python-ChatApp
2. Start the server

Windows

python server.py


macOS/Linux

python3 server.py


The server will print:

Server listening on 0.0.0.0:5050

3. Start a client (new terminal window)

Windows

python client.py 127.0.0.1 5050 YourName


macOS/Linux

python3 client.py 127.0.0.1 5050 YourName


You can open multiple clients to chat.

🔧 Troubleshooting

Port already in use → Change the PORT variable in server.py (e.g., 5051).

Firewall blocked → Allow Python through your firewall, or use 127.0.0.1 for local testing.

No output → Make sure both server and clients are running on the same host/network.

📓 Runbook (Ops-style)

Restart server → Ctrl+C, then python server.py

Rotate logs → Stop server → backup logs/server.log → restart server

Kick ghost users → Restart server (simple method for this demo)

🛠️ Frameworks & Tools
